These included important periodicals published in Bouillon, notably the Journal encyclopedique and Almanach Physico-Economique. Lutton, associated with most of these, lived in Paris. Evidence that Torcy was a key border point is found in a letter of the Bouillon publisher of the Journal Encyclopedique, Pierre Rousseau, to the bookseller-publisher-pirate Cazin, dated 12 April 1760, cited by Belin (Le commerces des livres prohibes a Paris, 1750-1789, pp. 48-9): 'A l'égard des nouveautés que vous voudriez avoir des pays étrangers, le sieur Weissembruck, directeur de mon
